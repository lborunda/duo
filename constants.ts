// --- SECURITY WARNING ---
// Storing API keys directly in your frontend code is a major security risk.
// These keys can be easily discovered by anyone inspecting your app's source code
// in a browser, which could lead to unauthorized use and unexpected charges from API providers.
// 
// For production applications, it is STRONGLY recommended to use a backend proxy
// to handle API requests, keeping your keys secure on a server.
